## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it.

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

### What I learned

This project was initially meant to reinforce my vanilla CSS and HTML skills. I learned new ways to make the website more responsive. for example, i was able to make image tags responisve using css:

```css 
#sugarcubes{
        content: url("images/mobile/image-gallery-sugar-cubes.jpg");
 }
```
my grid and felxbox skills were put to the test, because there were alot of nested elements that used a combination of grid and flexbox properties.

The best part of this project, was using the Figma design files. I was able to create an almost pixel perfect represantation of the figma design, while also learning who to navigate thorugh the Figma software.

### Continued development

I want to continue practicing on my speed of execution, I was a bit stumped on few flex box elements when it came to the way the are rendered
